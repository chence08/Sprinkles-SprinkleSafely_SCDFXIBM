SCDF Innovation Challenge 2020\
Problem Statement: **Climate Change**\
\
*Climate change is inevitable, with projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and performance. How might SCDF **leverage wearables or other technologies** to provide **relief or enhancement in harsh operating conditions** and **maximise the safety, health and performance of First Responders** during **training** and **operations**?*
